My name is Ammar. I'm currently a software engineer in e.solutions GmbH (https://www.esolutions.de). I'm originally from Lahore, Pakistan, but I moved to Germany in 2018 and
currently living in Ingolstadt. I love foods, i would say italian, desi and middle easter are my favourite's. I have never tried Pork and alcohol in my life.
I am married and have a kid. I love to travel and enjoy time with my family. My long term aspiration is to learn about my field as much as possible and
become a successful entrepreneur.
